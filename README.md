This repository contains the code I used to collect data for a EDA on box office performance.

Here is the original source of the data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aditya126/movies-box-office-dataset-2000-2024

In addition to this dataset, I used the TMDB API to collect information on budget, directors, and production companies for each movie record between 2014 and 2024.
